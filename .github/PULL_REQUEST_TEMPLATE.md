Before submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:

* [ ] Wrote [good commit messages][1].
* [ ] Commit message starts with `[Fix #issue-number]` (if the related issue exists).
* [ ] Feature branch is up-to-date with `master` (if not - rebase it).
* [ ] Squashed related commits together.
* [ ] Added tests.
* [ ] The PR relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
* [ ] Run `bundle exec rake`. It executes all tests and RuboCop for itself, and generates the documentation.
