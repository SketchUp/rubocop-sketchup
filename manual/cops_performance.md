## SketchupPerformance/OpenSSL

Enabled by default | Supports autocorrection
--- | ---
Enabled | No

There are performance issue with the OpenSSL library that Ruby ship. In
a clean SU session, default model there is a small delay observed in the
Windows version of SU.

But with a larger model loaded, or session that have had larger files
loaded the lag will be minutes.

`SecureRandom` is  also affected by this, as it uses OpenSSL to seed.

It also affects `Net::HTTP` if making HTTPS connections.

## SketchupPerformance/OperationDisableUI

Enabled by default | Supports autocorrection
--- | ---
Enabled | No

Operations should disable the UI for performance gain.

### Examples

```ruby
model = Sketchup.active_model
model.start_operation('Operation Name', true)
# <model changes>
model.commit_operation
```

## SketchupPerformance/SelectionBulkChanges

Enabled by default | Supports autocorrection
--- | ---
Enabled | No

Avoid modifying the selection set within loops. It's much faster to
change the selection in bulk. UI updates are triggered when you update
the selection, so reduce the amount of calls.

### Examples

#### Poor performance

```ruby
model = Sketchup.active_model
model.active_entities.each { |entity|
  model.selection.add(entity) if entity.is_a?(Sketchup::Face)
}
```
#### Better performance

```ruby
model = Sketchup.active_model
faces = model.active_entities.map { |entity|
  entity.is_a?(Sketchup::Face)
}
model.selection.add(faces)
```
#### Better performance and simpler

```ruby
model = Sketchup.active_model
faces = model.active_entities.grep(Sketchup::Face)
model.selection.add(faces)
```

## SketchupPerformance/Typename

Enabled by default | Supports autocorrection
--- | ---
Enabled | No

`.typename` is very slow, prefer `.is_a?` instead.

`entity.typename == 'Face'` is slow because it performs a string
comparison. `is_a?` is much faster because it's a simple type check.
