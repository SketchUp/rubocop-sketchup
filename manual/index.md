**RuboCop** is a Ruby static code analyzer. Out of the box it will
enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community
[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Most aspects of its behavior can be tweaked via various
[configuration options](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml).

Apart from reporting problems in your code, RuboCop can also
automatically fix some of the problems for you.
