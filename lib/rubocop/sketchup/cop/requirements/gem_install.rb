      # It's tempting to use gems in an extension. However, there are issues if
      # consuming them via Gem.install;
      #
      # * Net::HTTP is unreliable. (SSL certificate issues, OpenSSL performance
      #   freeze under Windows)
      # * Compiled extensions cannot be installed like this as they require
      #   DevKit.
      # * While downloading and installing SketchUp freezes. (Bad thing if done
      #   automatically upon loading the extensions - especially without user
      #   notice. It's easy to think SU have stopped working)
      # * Version collisions. If multiple extensions want to use different
      #   versions of a gem they will clash if the versions aren't compatible
      #   with the features they use.
      #
      # They only way to ensure extensions doesn't clash is to namespace
      # everything into extension namespace. This means making a copy of the
      # gem you want to use and wrap it in your own namespace.
